         Partiful is an app for creating aesthetic event pages, RSVPing, and sending 
         updates via text blast. While the platform is successful with pre-event 
         engagement, the post-event experience is underutilized. Our challenge was 
         to redesign a multi-screen iOS photo-sharing feature that deepens user 
         connection by making memories from IRL events feel communal and 
         lasting‚Äîwithout forcing awkward or public sharing.

         <h2>üë• Target Users <br> </h2>
         <p> 18‚Äì30 year-olds who take and share photos at social events. 
         Guests of these events want to share their photos and hosts want a streamlined 
         method of collecting said photos. </p> 
         <br>
         <h2>üí° User Pain Points <br> </h2>
         <p>Through research and informal interviews, we identified key barriers: 
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Social friction</strong>: Guests are hesitant to share photos 
            if they are not familiar with everyone who attended the event. </li> 
            <li><strong>Validation</strong>: There is little reward for uploading photos. </li> 
            <li><strong>Discoverability</strong>: Users often overlook the photo upload option.</li>
          </ul>
      </p>

        <h6>Merging Ideas</h6>
        <p>We held a collaborative review of our sketches and noted patterns across designs, 
          such as the need for visibility, validation, and navigation simplicity. Instead of 
          treating each sketch as separate, we combined the strongest elements from each.</p>

        <h5 class="feature-title">Add Photos</h5>

          <li>We kept the persistent upload button on the Events page to reduce discoverability friction.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="feature-item">
        <h5 class="feature-title">"My Albums" Tab</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>This tab supports photo visibility outside the event scroll, giving users an easy way to revisit and sort photo albums across all events.</li>

      <div class="feature-item">
        <h5 class="feature-title">Tagging + Social Interactions</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>We carried forward ideas like tagging, hearts, and comments to add validation for users.</li>
          <li>These live under each image, enabling engagement post-upload/post-event without the pressure of a public feed.</li>

      <div class="feature-item">
        <h5 class="feature-title">Event-Specific Photo Upload</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>Our sketch of a camera UI that saves to a specific event.</li>
          <li>This screen also integrates playful design (e.g., geofilters).</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="feature-item">
        <h5 class="feature-title">Reflection</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>Designing this feature list helped us think more holistically about how users engage with memories‚Äîbefore, during, and after events.</li>
          <li>We prioritized intuitive UI and low-friction interactions while staying mindful of emotional drivers like nostalgia, validation, and community.</li>
          <li>Through sketches and feedback loops, we learned how even small decisions (like tab placement or icon affordances) can significantly influence user behavior.</li>

      <h2>We received feedback for our initial wireframes from Grace, a design
        engineer at Partiful, and Michael, a Teaching Assistant for CSCI 1300. 
        Below we detail their feedback along with the ways 
        we incorporated it into our hi-fi prototype. 
      </h2><br> 
      <br />
      <h2 class="smallerh2 darkBlue">
        Grace "liked" the sticky bar with the slideshow of photos near the top
        of the event page.
      </h2>
      <br />
      <h2 class="smallerh2 textRight lightBlue">
        We maintained the sticky bar slideshow in our final design.
      </h2>
      <br />
      <h2 class="smallerh2 darkBlue">
        Grace said it "would be nice to show up to X photos [in the sticky bar
        slideshow] and gate everything else" for after partiers RSVP 'yes' to
        an event.
      </h2>
      <br />
      <h2 class="smallerh2 textRight lightBlue">
        We added an RSVP-based privacy feature to Partiful photos.
      </h2>
      <br />
       <h2 class="smallerh2 darkBlue">
        Michael said the original ‚Äúplus button icon‚Äù for the slideshow was confusing 
        because it makes him think he will be seeing more photos, not adding new ones.
      </h2>
      <br />
      <h2 class="smallerh2 textRight lightBlue">
        We changed the icon to be more descriptive (Photo Album with a plus sign) 
        and its location (before the slideshow) to be less confusing. 
      </h2>
      <br />
      <h2 class="smallerh2 darkBlue">
        Grace said the "add entry point" for the sticky bar slideshow "feels a
        little awkward" and noted theat the "space on h-scrolls is
        traditionally occupied by a > scroll button". She recommended that we
        "have a CTA at the very end of the h-scroll" so that partiers are able
        to see all content in the slideshow.
      </h2>
      <br />
      <h2 class="smallerh2 textRight lightBlue">
        We removed the add entry point at the end of the slideshow per Grace's recommendations.
        We did not include a CTA button as it made the section very cluttered when we prototyped it.
        Instead, a slider under the photos should appear when the slideshow is populated with more 
        photos.  
      </h2>
      <br />
      <h2 class="smallerh2 darkBlue">
        Grace noticed our introduction of an 'Albums' interface and concept
        and asked questions about whether "each event [was] an album" and "an
        album need[s] to be created or is something automatically an album" if
        it is attached to an event.
      </h2>
      <br />
      <h2 class="smallerh2 textRight lightBlue">
        We clarified the role of albums as collections of photos that are
         attached to events. Users can create an album for a specific purpose,
         but all photos added to an event will land in a catch-all "All Photos"
         album as well.

        Michael commented on making sure to keep spacing and proportion continuity from the app into our Hi-Fi Prototype as it seemed we deviated slightly with our Wireframes.

        Grace said the "upload button can be sticky/fixed" on an album page
        here since it is "such an important button" and that only one upload
        button "is needed" on the album page.

         We removed the additional upload button and made it sticky.

          Using Figma Workflows, we clarified the entry point(s) for the

      <p>Moving forward, we used Figma to build an interactive prototype with linked screens and 
      interactions. Key flows include the pre-RSVP view, uploading to an album, and geofilters for 
      photos. We leaned into fun, feedback-rich interactions and subtle nudges, rather than
      heavy social pressure. You can view the prototype <a href="https://www.figma.com/proto/NqI13j4565lEvriQupFu3P/%F0%9F%90%BB-Partiful-x-Brown-U-2025--Internal-Working-Copy-?node-id=0-1&t=Y544yr8u9nsJZNlA-1">here</a>

      </div>
      <p>We presented our final Hi-Fi Prototype to Grace who really 
        enjoyed seeing our progress and the changes we made. Grace 
        specifically appreciated how our approach was more ‚Äúgrounded‚Äù 
        rather than being too ‚Äúgimmicky.‚Äù Unfortunately, we learned 
        that the Photos project is on pause and she was unsure if our 
        suggestions fit into the roadmap.
        <br>
        If we had more time with the Hi-Fi  Prototype, we would have loved 
        to include more interactions to feed into the social media aspect of 
        Partiful. It would have also been very helpful to explore different 
        edge cases, like wanting to make certain photos visible before RSVP-ing 
        or when there are only a few photos uploaded. Overall, we are really with
        the progress we made during this project and are excited to see how Partiful 
        moves forward with their Photos feature.
